# Nihal Nick — Modeling Agency Website

Static site for Nihal Nick (personal modeling/agency site). This repository contains a simple static HTML site (index.html) plus assets.

## What I added
- `index.html` — improved HTML with accessibility and best-practice tweaks.
- `README.md` — basic repo description and instructions to preview locally.

## How to preview locally
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/nick132773/Nihalnick.git
2. Move into the repo and open `index.html` in your browser:
   - Double-click index.html, or
   - Serve locally with a simple HTTP server:
     - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000` then visit http://localhost:8000

## Notes
- I will add `style.css` in a new branch named Nihalnick.
